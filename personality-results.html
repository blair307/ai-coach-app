        growthStory: 'Brad has a lot of energy. When he is "on," he can get any group of people to roll with laughter. He will have them in stitches, and build momentum as he tells story after story. After his "performances," everyone\'s faces were sore from smiling and they would be tired from laughing. But Brad wasn\'t truly happy. He knew, deep down, he felt empty despite his performances. His work felt empty. His relationship with his wife felt hollow. And when left alone, he felt lost. Brad was tired of performing but didn\'t know how to stop. He was known as the entertainer, the funny one, the guy everyone could count on for a good time. He felt stuck in performance and felt overlooked as a complete person. Dissonance grew between his "performances" and his personal life, and he fell into a depression. "If I didn\'t laugh, I\'d cry," he\'d tell his therapist. Unmoved and not entertained, the therapist would ask, "What would be so wrong with crying?" Brad started to sob as he began to realize why he felt so stuck. Brad grew up in a family in chaos. As the youngest, he couldn\'t understand how his family members could inflict so much pain on one another. As an impulse, he began to crack jokes, do characters, and entertain his family. At times, he could get them to stop fighting. He found he could "break the tension" with his wit. He was the youngest, but somehow he became responsible for keeping the peace by entertaining (distracting) his family. His humor was adaptive and highly entertaining. It utilized his quick wit, creative nature, and ability to read a room. It was his superpower. Unfortunately for him, it was highly celebrated. He received compliments, affirmations on his cleverness, and the sweet relief of a respite from the fighting. Over time his performance—instead of being a temporary state of being—became his default setting. He wore a smile no matter what the situation and entertained even when he had no energy left. After his painful realization about his family and his role, he began to invite his close friends and family into other facets of his personality: deep thinking, sadness, anger, quiet creativity, and more. Slowly, he began to feel known more for who he was instead of how he could make others feel. A peace slowly blanketed his life as he realized he was surrendering to his more well-rounded nature. Brad still entertains. He can make others laugh (sometimes breathlessly), but he doesn\'t feel the compulsion to do it. He can turn it on or off. He can be energetic or at rest. At long last, he feels comfortable allowing all aspects of himself to be known.'

        growthStory: 'Beth is universally known as "a sweetheart." Her kindness and patience with others endears her to almost everyone she meets. Friends and family alike come to her for counsel, support, and healing advice; and she has an intuitive gift to give it. However, she had struggled in her personal life. She found herself overly emotional, wrestling with self value, and consistently trying to "fix" herself through self-help or counseling. It hadn\'t worked. She had an internal monologue that constantly questioned, "What is wrong with me? How can I fix my pain? What else do I have to do?" In many ways, she felt defeated. Through a series of fortunate events, she began to get clarity on her situation. She had grown up in a family at war. Her dad and mom fought viciously until their seemingly inevitable divorce. She was 7 years old at the time. Instead of being able to disassociate from the pain, and rightfully place the responsibility for the divorce on her parents...she blamed herself. She was still in the egocentric stage of development during her family\'s turmoil, so whatever happened to her was "because of her." In addition, she wanted to feel empowered against her pain, so she further assumed if it were her fault she could do something about it. Unfortunately, this was her gift-of-healing gone awry. Her sense of responsibility ran so deep she subconsciously took ownership of almost every negative situation in her life: her mom\'s cancer, her dad\'s depression, her brother\'s drug addiction, her poor treatment in her marriage. She was responsible for the pain of the world. It was all her fault. She hadn\'t realized this on the surface, of course, but deep down she knew it was because of her. After her "enlightenment," she started getting clarity on what was her responsibility and what was not. She made intentional decisions to start exporting areas of false responsibility from every stage of her life. She gave herself permission to feel angry, disappointed, and even sad about what had happened to her. She was no longer responsible for everything and everyone. Unsurprisingly, she found herself feeling much lighter. She was no longer trying to solve equations without the variables, or taking responsibility for situations that weren\'t hers. She gained clarity on her life, and felt empowered to make changes to better her situation. Her emotions stabilized because she was no longer internalizing the pain and disappointment of others. Counseling others became enjoyable because she was no longer owning their pain or need for a solution. She found her voice in her romantic relationship, and changes were gradually made to make the relationship beyond satisfying. By exporting false responsibility, she found the outlines of her identity and personality. She became happy. She became herself.'

        growthStory: 'Jake had a reasonable life. Ever since he could remember, it had been just "okay." Fine grades. Respectable job. He\'d never thrived, but he\'d never been destitute either. The problem was, Jake always knew he was meant for more. He had a deep inner-craving for making a difference and having a thriving romantic relationship. As it was, he had a job most would consider admirable...but it wasn\'t inspiring for him. His relationship with his wife was even more mediocre. It had flashes of greatness with large stretches of the unexceptional. Together, they had settled into a repetitive lifestyle of similar activities on different days. Jake wasn\'t unsatisfied. He just couldn\'t get over the feeling that life didn\'t feel... complete. After reaching his late thirties, having two children, a middling relationship with his wife, and going in and out of mild depressions, he decided to seek help. He worked with an insightful therapist and started making significant realizations. Primarily, he realized that he was "deathly afraid of being his fully powerful, authentic self." Early in life he had concluded that his thriving equated to him being alone. It made sense considering his background and temperament. Jake is a particularly gifted man, and when growing up, his family was in turmoil. He subconsciously concluded that his expressing his fully powerful self would create more tension in the household. In fact, it might isolate him further from an already fragile and disconnected family. In essence, he learned he must "play small" in order to maintain any semblance of intimacy with those he loved. After a few months of heart-rending work with his therapist, he realized his determination that "being himself equals being alone" was untrue. In fact, hiding his authentic self keeps him alone; he can\'t be seen, known, or loved if he isn\'t showing up as himself. As a result of his insights, he started making intentional changes to express his true nature. He became more bold at work. He started being more goofy and playful with his wife. He found himself enjoying his children more often and more easily. He allowed himself to grow into his authentic self. He found, as most Peacemakers do, that the world is not antagonistic to powerful authenticity but waiting on bated breath for it to emerge.'

She asks insightful questions, and has seemingly no limit to how she cares for others. Her family jokes that she can\'t be taken anywhere without someone sharing their life story with her. For the most part, Sarah likes her life. She has a lot of good friends where she feels loved and connected. Her husband is a kind man, good worker, and well-liked by almost everyone. The only problem was a lingering thought, "I don\'t feel truly seen. I would love someone to understand me the way I see and understand others." Her gift, although truly appreciated by Sarah, almost always made the other person the focal point. Whether it was her mom, best friend, husband, random person on the street, pastor, or anyone else, conversations always became focused on the other person. She loved "seeing others," but felt an emptiness for not feeling truly seen herself. Even worse, she didn\'t know how to change this pattern because getting to know others felt so natural and easy. Sarah\'s life-pivot came on a night with several friends. The friends guided the conversation to be focused on Sarah, and they began asking questions: "What do you really want to do? Where do you feel seen and unseen? What brings you the most life? What would you like people to know about you? How can we support and champion you?" The surprise of being the focal point flooded Sarah with emotions. She sob-cried through her answers. Her friends, intuitively knowing Sarah\'s gift was being flipped on her, wouldn\'t relent. They spent several hours relishing getting to know Sarah. Many exclaimed, "I never truly saw you before tonight." Sarah, without saying so aloud, agreed with them. Upon reflection, Sarah realized that she had learned to be the listener (the curious one) when she was growing up in her family. She had a knack for asking good questions, making others feel seen and heard, and it felt good to make others feel loved. Unfortunately, she didn\'t know how to receive in the same manner (or it wasn\'t offered). She learned to care about others, but not to expect similar care in return. After her shocking night of "being seen," Sarah started to feel worthy of being known. She realized that her sharing about herself was a different form of loving and connecting with others. She still defaults to "getting to know others," but she is now willing to be seen and share about herself.'

        growthStory: 'Frank was a man with exceptional faith. He had a beaming personality, and was always gregarious, hopeful, and kind. His faith in God was firm, and his confidence in others was unwavering. He was a pillar for others emotionally, and a source of strength for many. Sadly, he went through a difficult season that shook his beliefs to the core. He was praying for a sick friend whom he thought would get better. His friend passed away. He invested in a business venture with "Christian" men. He was defrauded. He spent multiple years in Christian counseling with his wife. His wife divorced him anyway. His hardships challenged his perception of God, and his confidence in other people. For several years, he held in tension a firm sense of faith with a sense of disillusionment based on his experiences. He couldn\'t reconcile a loving God with his pain and disappointment. He decided to visit with a pastor whom he trusted. The pastor, after hearing his story, empathized with Frank. He acknowledged how painful his experience must have been, and how it must have challenged his faith. Frank cried softly. He finally felt validated in feeling weak and confused after pretending to be so strong. Frank and his pastor met several times over the course of the next several weeks. The pastor helped Frank mature his sense of faith. He shared, "We don\'t understand how everything works, so we must live with expectancy and not expectations. Living with an open hope doesn\'t disappoint, but expectations will." He talked to Frank about not giving people his trust simply because they were "Christians," but to seek counsel from people who are wise in the areas he was considering. And finally, the pastor shared how life will give us ample evidence to accuse God or to believe He must not exist (or not be loving). BUT, he concluded, "God doesn\'t prevent all pain, but he does want to be near us in it." Frank didn\'t feel better all at once. He was still hurt, angry, and sad about what had happened. It took time to release the emotions that had built in him through his disappointments. But slowly, intentionally and incrementally, he started to feel peace and hope again. He learned to live with "question marks," but still have faith. He grew in his ability to discern what was trustworthy without being bitter or cynical. Challenging his faith refined it to the point of being immovable despite circumstances. Frank\'s confidence in God through hardships created a depth that could be experienced by those going through similar difficulties. He learned to share vulnerably about his pain, and to be with others in theirs. His faith grew to experience a God that didn\'t orchestrate or intentionally cause pain, but didn\'t prevent it either. It created an unshakable confidence in God\'s presence despite circumstances.'

He is also extremely passionate, and works with almost frenetic energy when he gets struck with inspiration. Despite all of his giftings, he has a glaring weakness: follow-through. He will have an idea, a revelation, or a new project regularly; but just as regularly, abandon it after it has lost its luster. As a result, he never seems to get traction on his ideas or ventures. In fact, he is consistently frustrated because he will often find someone being successful in the "space" that he recently abandoned. It often sounds like, "Hey! I thought of that" or, "I had that same idea two years ago!" For most of his adult life, he has worked for corporations. They mildly value his talent but don\'t recognize his true value. As such, he has tried to launch out several times in entrepreneurial ventures. Every time, the idea sounds completely feasible, potentially even destined for success. But the success never comes to fruition, and he is forced to go back to a corporation or start a new venture. His breakthrough came with the simplest of revelations: he could grow something incrementally instead of explosively. The thought haunted him for months before he started implementing it. He reviewed his history with work and was able to find a consistent pattern of frenetic starts and sabotaging endings. He harnessed his new insight into practical action. Instead of working from frantic passion, he began to view things from a more objective standpoint. He started considering projects and decisions in the long-view, which often required short-term sacrifices. Tyson\'s mindset went from using his exceptional natural giftings explosively to nurturing his talents over the long-term. After two years of engaging with the same venture, developing and refining it over time, his business became fruitful. Tyson created a business consulting practice. At first, there was minimal traction. Over time, he developed his repertoire, curriculum, strategies, and ability to speak and sell to his potential clients. He found a way to embrace his ability to be extremely creative in his business (for his clients and himself), but he partnered it with the practical necessities of building over time. Tyson is thriving. He\'s surrounded himself with numerous people who are able to take his ideas and put them into practical use: for social media, business, marketing materials, and more. They also gently remind him when he is becoming a little too ready to make a knee jerk reaction. Tyson allowed himself to mature without sacrificing what makes him unique. As a result, he feels like himself but gets to enjoy the abundance of following through on his ideas.'

        growthStory: 'Beth was imaginative. Her friends and family might call it "distracted." Her time in school was a significant force of will. She didn\'t want to be distracted in her classes, but she always found her mind wandering. The same thing happened in the workplace. She would be neck deep in a project, and her mind would begin weaving fantastical stories. Her mind especially wandered when she was doing tedious or repetitive activities. Put simply, she was miserable. It felt like her inner world and outer world were in conflict with one another. Her dreams were full of fantasy, engagement, adventure, plot development, and powerful character expression. Her day-to-day life was a typical, almost hum-drum experience. She went to work, did her job, came home, and then did it all over again. Ironically, the more anxious she became the more she would day-dream, which would make her more anxious. "She needed to focus!", she would tell herself over and over. It never seemed to work. Finally, she sought help. She started working with a life coach to help her break the mental ruts she had created for herself. This particular life coach was brilliant. He started to ask her about her experiences as a child, at school, and in the workplace. He discovered that she had been in near-constant war with her nature. Essentially, she was trying to direct the flow of her "life river" to match the culture, but it was always trying to self-correct. After several sessions, they created a game plan for her to start aligning with her more natural self. She didn\'t quit her job, but she did start writing stories as a hobby. Writing started off slowly as she learned to find her voice and sharpen her craft. It soon became her obsession. Over the next several years she found herself developing beautiful manuscripts, and was in the process of seeking an agent for her work. Interestingly, she would love her work to be published but it wasn\'t a compelling need for her. She loved writing, and it was satisfying to simply do the work. Additionally, her work life started excelling! Giving herself an opportunity to vent her creativity in the evenings allowed her to focus on her work during the day. If she had an idea, she would write it down, which would allow her to comfortably re-engage with her work without fear of losing the concept. Eventually, she did get published. With the proceeds from the book (and her teaching writing classes) she was able to leave her corporate job and work full time in the writing industry. Her life was fulfilling, constantly changing, and allowing her to come into agreement with her natural design.'

She improved the way she dressed. She gave a facelift to her website. And she started talking about herself differently. Another significant thing she did was to approach her services objectively. Instead of thinking of it as "her offerings," she considered it from an outside perspective. She found that she loved, valued, and respected the services she was rendering. After her personal and professional insights, she began talking differently about her business. She found sharing about it didn\'t make her feel gross or selfish, but expressed and authentic. People soon responded to her sense of confidence and newfound clarity by utilizing her services. She booked out her practice, started selling curriculum, and gracefully found her sweet spot. She had a newfound sense of peace because she had worked out the dissonance between her gift of promotion and her personal desires. They were no longer in conflict.

How can someone identify their passions? What must I do to find purpose?". As might be expected, those she interviewed didn\'t always have eloquent answers.

        growthStory: 'Bethany likes achievement. It isn\'t a character flaw; it\'s a character trait. She\'s always been like that. When she was younger, she wanted to complete her homework assignments before stopping working. When her friends had ideas, she would want to implement them and put them into action. She enjoyed taking action on ideas, but more than simply working on them, she wanted to bring them to fruition. Her cleverness and ability to complete assignments gave her continual promotions at work. She found herself being given more and more authority as she became known as someone that "got things done." Lingering projects, stalled ventures, and half-baked products were her specialty. She could bring these, and other challenges, through to completion. Despite her successes, Bethany knew something was missing from her life. Her relationship with her husband was shallow. They, both being high achievers, had unquestionably prioritized work over their relationship. Although they truly cared for one another, they hadn\'t invested in their relationship in some time. As a result, they slowly became "ships passing in the night." She also found that life in general had become dull. It was almost as if her senses had been turned down, and her emotions had followed. Her sadnesses, joys, passion, purpose, hopes, dreams, etc. had all been tempered. She wasn\'t so much living as passing through life. As an act of desperation, she went to visit the Life Coach her business had employed. He was brilliant and experienced. He saw the symptoms of her malady almost immediately. He helped her to voice her true priorities. To her surprise, it was almost the opposite of how she had been living. She wanted to live in the present, but she was living for the rare moments of accomplishment. She wanted to prioritize intimacy, but was instead prioritizing her career. She was prioritizing completing a project, instead of developing in the process. In essence, she wasn\'t ever "stopping to smell the roses." After her realizations, she started making incremental changes to her lifestyle. She started focusing on her staff more personally, instead of through the metrics. She prioritized her relationship with her husband...even if that meant postponing the completion of a project. She also created boundaries around her job so that she could re-balance her life with friends, community, and relaxation. To her surprise, her work became more fruitful. Her staff responded to her newfound investment in them. Productivity and creativity flourished. Her relationship with her husband became intimate and affectionate. And possibly most importantly, she was present in her life again. She had regained her sense of balance, and with it came her sense of peace and joyful personality.'

        growthStory: 'Byron knew he was influential. He always had "the gift" to get people to do what they didn\'t think they could. It was first obvious in middle and high school. He would convince his friends to break rules or get into some hijinx or other. They never did anything malicious, but Byron was always convincing his friends to join him in doing something he didn\'t want to do alone (or at least, not get caught by himself). Byron enjoyed his influence until his early twenties. He was in Student Government throughout his schooling and often spoke at various events around town. He was thoroughly enjoyed as a presenter, and often brought attention or resources to those events where he spoke. However, he had a crisis of conscience at 23. He felt convicted about his ability to influence, and started to wonder whether it was just a form of manipulation. He also couldn\'t shake the idea he was speaking for his own adoration and attention rather than doing something meaningful. He was horrified. As a result of his "insights," he backed away from publicity. He focused on being as upright as possible in his job, relationships, and friendships. He became an entrepreneur, and found joy in his innovative strategies and unique work. But he knew, deep down, something was missing. His revelation came during a night talking with friends over beers. They were discussing "what you like to do most," and Byron blurted out public speaking. He surprised himself and his friends. When he realized what he had said, he felt a massive grief sweep over him, similar to feeling the lost time with an estranged friend. He missed public speaking. He missed motivating. He missed influencing and encouraging. His friends interrogated him about his desire, and they soon realized that his motivations weren\'t bad...they never had been. His intentions were always positive when he was speaking. And furthermore, he felt the most alive and like himself when he was doing it. Instead of being manipulative, they reasoned, his public speaking was a needed motivation for others to take action on their dreams and latent desires. In fact, by squelching his gift for speaking, he was robbing others of his unique capacity to inspire. Relief flooded Byron as he was able to accept himself and his desire to publicly speak. Over the next several months he began to embrace his long-dormant ability. He started with small events, but the events soon grew in size and enthusiasm. His businesses became far more successful; his audience took massive steps to improving their lives; and he had the distinct sense of "coming home" to self.'

        growthStory: 'Belinda was a hothead. At least, that is what her friends and family called her. She would get upset at people she loved and those she didn\'t alike. It seemed she was always provoked in one way or another. But Belinda was misunderstood. Belinda is, in actuality, a softie. She protects her tender insides with a bold and sometimes abrasive exterior. Unfortunately, her tough exterior was wearing thin on her family, friends, and colleagues. Her relationships were strained in every direction and she didn\'t know what to do. Belinda wasn\'t trying to threaten her primary relationships. In fact, it was quite the opposite. She would get upset when she felt her connection with someone was being threatened. It was almost a default response to angrily try to persuade them that they weren\'t thinking right, or that they had misinterpreted her. Sadly, what Belinda thought was the medicine (convincing the other person she was right) was actually far worse than the disease (differing opinions). At almost any point, she could salvage trust and connection if the issue hadn\'t escalated; but that wasn\'t Belinda\'s strong-suit. Belinda\'s breakthrough came from a particularly painful night. After getting into yet another fight with her spouse, she broke down sobbing. She couldn\'t stop crying as it seemed the world was going to swallow her up. She felt empty. Unseen. Unheard. And completely alone. After her harrowing night, she committed to getting help. Luckily, she knew of a remarkably powerful older woman in her church. This woman, who was no wallflower, had many of the same qualities as Belinda but was almost universally loved. "This woman, if anyone, will know what to do," Belinda told herself. She humbly told the woman her situation, and how much pain she was in. She didn\'t spare any details including her own culpability. The woman, with kindness in her smile, shared with Belinda: "I\'ve been where you are at now. I know exactly how you feel. When younger, I was a hothead, but it wasn\'t because I didn\'t care but because I DID! I was trying to protect those I love from outside threats, protect my relationships from misunderstandings, and I was so afraid that I would be left all alone if I didn\'t get clarity in whatever was happening. Fortunately, my husband was willing to speak to me boldly and honestly. He said disagreement is not disconnection and that I was secure in our relationship, but the threat was my temper...When I used anger, I was actually pushing people away...even if they stayed in the room. His words gave me permission to disagree and still feel loved and seen. They helped me recognize I was being my own worst enemy. Since that time, I still say my piece but I don\'t do it with anger or violence. I do it in love. If they don\'t take the feedback, I\'m okay with them making that decision (and living with the consequences). I get to be the powerful me, but I don\'t feel so insecure that I have to use my temper to protect myself or try to protect my relationships." Belinda was dumbfounded. She knew her anger had also been her insecurity with relationships and fear she would be alone. But if what the woman said was true, she was working against herself. After their conversation, Belinda started practicing being comfortable with disagreement. She also worked on confrontation without anger, anxiety, or high stakes. Healthy confrontation became a tool to provide clarity in relationships, and often became valued by the other person as well. Her husband had never felt closer to her, Belinda felt truly authentic, and she learned that her power doesn\'t have to be "violent" in order to be present.'

He found himself in the middle of a business that didn\'t share his passion for excellence. In typical entrepreneur form, his boss wanted productivity over having every "t" crossed and "i" dotted for each project. Justin was frustrated, because in his mind, with just a little more effort the projects and products could be vastly improved.

        growthStory: 'Kim wasn\'t particularly liked. It wasn\'t that she wasn\'t likable; it was just that she found issues wherever she looked. When she went grocery shopping, she knew all the ways the grocer was running their businesses wrong. When she was out with friends, she was giving relationship advice (even when it wasn\'t called for). When she worked for a business, she couldn\'t help but find all the shortcomings and end up frustrating her bosses. In other words, sometimes it was hard to be around Kim. Kim always had a clever and strategic mind. She could take in large amounts of information, and quickly zero in on what needed improving. Often, she would have a solution in hand before even analyzing a situation. She could do it intuitively. She was also appreciated, to be sure, but sometimes not enjoyed when in \'fix it\' mode. For all her efforts, Kim found she was never satisfied. She hadn\'t developed the depth of community she wanted, and hadn\'t found a business where she seemed to fit (despite working in a number of arenas). Kim decided to go to a profession-matching fair. The fair lasted several days, and had applicants go through a number of tests. After tallying the results, participants would be matched to their best potential careers (and given training in that industry). To her surprise, Kim scored off the charts in the "business consulting" industry. Her gifts aligned perfectly with the short-term SWAT team process a business consultant uses to serve clients. The idea gave her everything she wanted in a job: meet new people, learn about various industries, help businesses thrive, find problems and offer solutions, and only spend limited amounts of time in one business. After being trained for 12 weeks, she was hired by a business consulting firm. Unsurprisingly, she thrived. Not only did she thrive, but she found that the outlet of "problem solving" at work allowed her to disconnect when she was at home. She had "scratched the itch" of problem solving, and found it much easier to relax and simply be present with friends and family. In fact, she became extremely intentional about NOT solving people\'s problems. She only offered solutions or insights when she was directly asked. She found that this new "only when asked" mentality made her feel wanted, and allowed the other person to feel comfortable and not assaulted with solutions. After only 2 years, Kim became a project supervisor in her business. She now oversees a team of 6 business consultants. Most importantly, she found a business (and lifestyle) that allows her to be herself. She finally feels seen and understood for who she is, and gets to be appreciated and rewarded for her unique talents.'

        growthStory: 'Madelyn is intelligent. From a very young age, she was surprising family and friends with her insights and ability to understand situations. In many ways, she was advanced for her age. She could figure out circumstances, and even relational dynamics, starting in grade school. Her ability to understand made her a natural leader with her friends. Unfortunately, her strengths also became her weaknesses. She was struggling in relationships and with anxiety. Instead of seeking help, she did what she normally did, and tried to "figure out" what was wrong. Her incessant need for understanding and resolution caused her to dig deeply into self-help, self-improvement, and psychology. The information she learned was insightful and interesting, but never provided the relief she was seeking. After over a decade of "working on herself" with psychology, she began to feel disillusioned. She thought, "Shouldn\'t this have worked by now? What am I doing wrong?" She felt stuck treading water with feelings she couldn\'t adequately diagnose or cure. Eventually, she humbled herself and sought clinical help. She worked with a Family and Marriage Therapist who was recommended by her best friend. At first, she was reluctant to engage in the process because it felt vulnerable to let someone into her inner world. But after a few months, she started becoming truly vulnerable. After speaking with her therapist, they clarified her natural defense mechanism: overthinking. Madelyn learned that she turned to thinking whenever she was stressed or felt tension in a relationship. Essentially, she would go into a fix it or figure it out mode which inevitably would make her more stressed. Her therapist helped her realize that she was trying to intellectually process her feelings. In other words, she was trying to fix what needed to be felt. Madelyn started making space for her feelings and giving herself permission to not understand them. She found herself crying uncontrollably, becoming angry, and expressing long-dormant grief from her childhood. It wasn\'t comfortable at first, but it was relieving. The pressure in her life subsided as she processed her pent-up feelings. She found herself comfortable in the present, and much more available for connection with others. Madelyn still uses her intellect. She enjoys understanding her process, emotions, and relational dynamics. But, she has learned to be comfortable feeling emotions without the need to dissect or understand them.'
